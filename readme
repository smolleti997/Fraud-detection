Fraud Detection Model — Overview

This project builds a Logistic Regression–based fraud detection model using Python and scikit-learn. The workflow covers data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and performance evaluation.

📂 Steps Performed
1. Data Loading
Loaded the dataset using pandas (read_csv).
Stored it in a DataFrame for processing.

2. Feature Selection
Selected key variables such as:
Transaction amount
Account balance
Risk score
Transaction type
Failed transactions in last 7 days
Previous fraudulent activity
Defined Fraud_Label as the target variable.

🔧 3. Data Preprocessing
Categorical Encoding
Used one-hot encoding to convert Transaction_Type into numerical binary columns.drop_first=True avoids multicollinearity.

Feature Scaling
Applied StandardScaler to normalize numeric features so they have:
Mean = 0
Standard deviation = 1
Helps the model converge faster and perform better.

🧪 4. Train–Test Split

Split the data into:
80% training (used to learn patterns)
20% testing (used to evaluate performance)
Used stratification so the fraud ratio stays consistent across splits.
Set random_state=42 for reproducibility.

🤖 5. Model Training
Trained a Logistic Regression classifier with:
class_weight='balanced' to handle class imbalance (fraud cases are rare).
max_iter=1000 to ensure the model has enough iterations to converge.
During training, the model learns weights (coefficients) for each feature that help determine the probability of a transaction being fraudulent.
🔮 6. Prediction

Used the trained model to predict fraud on the test dataset:
predict() → outputs 0 (legit) or 1 (fraud)
These predictions are compared with actual labels to measure performance.

📊 7. Model Evaluation
Confusion Matrix
Shows how many transactions were:
True Positives (TP): correctly predicted fraud
True Negatives (TN): correctly predicted non-fraud
False Positives (FP): predicted fraud but actually legit
False Negatives (FN): missed fraud
Used to assess model strengths and weaknesses.

Classification Report
Includes:
Precision: How many predicted fraud cases were actually fraud
Recall: How many actual fraud cases the model caught
F1-score: Balance of precision and recall
Support: Number of samples per class

Model Coefficients
Printed the learned weights for each feature.
Helps interpret which features increase or decrease fraud probability.

🎯 Purpose

This workflow prepares, trains, and evaluates a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent based on financial behavior and historical activity. It provides a clear, end-to-end approach for fraud classification tasks.
